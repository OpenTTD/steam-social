# Steamworks SDK

This branch mirrors the Steamworks SDK.

Normally this is available on https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/, but for one reason or another, it can only be downloaded in an automated way sometimes.
Other times it first requires logging in.
When it does or doesn't work seems unpredictable.

This makes any CI automation completely impractical: you don't want a CI that sometimes work.

As such, this branch exists to mirror the SDK, so it can be used by the CI.
